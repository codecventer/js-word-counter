Turati JavaScript Word Counter Assessment

This assessment has proven to be challenging and required extensive research in order to find a solution for the requested task. This task required me to create a JavaScript application with the ability to calculate the total number of words in a book, calculate the longest word and print these results in the Google Chrome inspection window console.

Learning & Observation:
It was rather challenging to find a solution for the requested task. I was able to create function which allows a set of text to be printed into a following function. The second function allows the user to then count the total number of words in the given text area, in which the first function’s result is printed.

My goal was to create an application that allows the user to click a button for the program to print the text within a .txt file into a text area which is then calculated to display the total number of words.

Measures took for the solution to be accurate:
Throughout my progress in creating the requested solution I had to do extensive research about printing the content of a .txt file into a text area with a click action. I had to convert book pdf to .txt file but it was with further research that I found out it is impossible to display the content of a requested file which is not provided by the user. This is due to internet/website security features and protocols.

One alternative solution requires the user to copy all the text within the provided war-and-peace.txt file and paste it inside the given text area to be calculated.

A final solution I found would be using PHP to send the user’s file submission request to be processed and displayed. Unfortunately I do not have the experience with PHP to complete this requisition function. With that being said, please find my comments with further explanation included in the project file.
